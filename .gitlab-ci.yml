# Some words on how caching works in GitLab CI:
#   Only sub-directories of the build directory can be added
#   to the cache. Expansion of variables does not work. We
#   will only keep the `wrapper` and `caches` sub-directories
#   of Gradle in the cache. Gradle will place those into
#   $HOME/.gradle by default. To be able to save them, they
#   need to be present in the build directory. By setting
#   `GRADLE_USER_HOME` we make Gradle place the directories
#   into a location from which we can move them to the cache
#   (and retrieve them from there again). Although the cache
#   directory is available as `/cache` you cannot directly
#   interact with it. Data will only be transferred to and
#   from the build directory. (It took me a while to get it
#   rightâ€¦)
