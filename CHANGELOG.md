## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2021-06-14
### Changed
- Return scores in PwC data as their original string value. (Closes: [#310](https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-backend/-/issues/310))

## [0.3.0] - 2021-05-12
### Added
- New points to support the Papers With Code (PWC) use case. Results from AI publications can now be queried for display in leaderboards. (Closes: [#263](https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-backend/-/issues/263))
### Changed
- Dropped `rdf4k` dependency by replacing it with RDF4J. This should fix the build failures on GitLab as a side effect, caused by the shutdown of Bintray/JCenter. The Kotlin-specific extensions were not used in the codebase, so the library effectively only pulled in RDF4J.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-04
### Added
- Caching of predicates to improve performance.
- A script to load an existing Neo4j database dump into a Docker container (development).
  It should also run properly on Windows. (Fingers crossedâ€¦)
- Annotation processing during development is properly supported now. It may require you to run the "clean" task once before the stubs are generated and picked up by your IDE.
- Shared run configurations for IntelliJ IDEA to support the development workflow.
### Changed
- Default roles will be created on start-up if they do not exist already.
### Fixed
- Top contributions are now sorted correctly. (Closes: [#265](https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-backend/-/issues/265))
- The ID generators will now skip over IDs already used by entities due to manual creation, instead of generating an error. (Closes: [#94](https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-backend/-/issues/94))

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-30
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file. Finally!
