= How to populate the Postgres database with dummy data

Sometimes a Neo4j database dump does not contain all information needed for debugging, e.g. user accounts, organizations and observatories.
They are stored in a separate Postgres database that cannot be shared for security reasons.
To populate the Postgres database with dummy data you can use the following gradle task:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew populatePostgresDatabase
----

It will automatically generate dummy user accounts for contributors found in the Neo4j database.
Additionally, all organizations and observatories will be fetched from the live server and stored in the local Postgres database.
