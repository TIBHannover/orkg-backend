== Comparing `OffsetDateTime`

When comparing timestamps, care needs to be taken, especially with timestamps that contain an offset.
Two timestamps representing the same instant can be expressed in a way where they differ in their representations, so calling `equals()` will produce `false`.
In certain cases, we would like to know if the timestamps represents the same instant, so `isEqual()` needs to be used.

This is illustrated in the example below:

[source,kotlin]
----
// These two timestamps refer to the same instant
val withOffset = OffsetDateTime.parse("2023-11-30T09:25:14.049+01:00")
val withZulu = OffsetDateTime.parse("2023-11-30T08:25:14.049Z")

// The two timestamps are not equal by equals():
require(withOffset != withZulu)

// They are equal by isEquals(), because it compares the instants
require(withOffset.isEqual(withZulu))
----
