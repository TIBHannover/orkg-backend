= Filter Configs

A filter config is an url-encoded json-list of search filters.
They can be used to make advanced search queries on papers, providing a way for users to find the papers they are actually interested in.
Each search filter is of the following structure:

include::{snippets}/filter-configs-get-single/response-body.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/filter-configs-get-single/response-fields.adoc[]
