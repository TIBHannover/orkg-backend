= Contributions

Contributions represent a collection of concepts in the knowledge graph.
They can be seen as a collection of <<Resources,resources>>, <<Literals,literals>> and <<Predicates,predicates>>.
The provided endpoints aggregate these concepts and provide a unified contribution representation.

NOTE: The following endpoints use content negotiation, meaning that the contents of the response json depend on the specified `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers of each request.
