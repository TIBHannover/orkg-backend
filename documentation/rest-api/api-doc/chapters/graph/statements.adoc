= Statements

A statement represents a kind of sentence in the knowledge graph,
similar to RDF triples.
Similar to a real sentence, it is a tuple of a subject, a predicate, and
an object.

Subjects and objects represent nodes in the graph are formed from a
<<Resources,resource>>.
Objects can also be a <<Literals,literal value>>.

<<Predicates>> represent edges (relationships) in the graph.

Resources and predicates are identifiable by an ID, whereas literals are
not since they represent a value.

Statements can also be referenced by their IDs.
This allows storing and retrieving provenance information about them.

[[statements-fetch]]
== Fetching Statements

A `GET` request provides information about a statement.

operation::statements-get-single[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

[[statements-list]]
== Listing Statements

A `GET` request lists all the statements:

TIP: {pagination_note}

operation::statements-get-paged[snippets='curl-request']

The following list of request parameters are supported:

operation::statements-get-paged-with-parameters[snippets='query-parameters,curl-request']

[[statements-create]]
== Creating Statements
A `POST` request creates a new statement.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The statement can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

[NOTE]
====
1. If the subject, predicate or object cannot be found, the return status will be `400 BAD REQUEST`.
2. If the subject is a rosetta stone statement, the return status will be `400 BAD REQUEST`.
3. If the statement represents a list element statement, the return status will be `400 BAD REQUEST`.
4. If the subject is a literal, the return status will be `400 BAD REQUEST`.
5. If a statement id is provided and a statement with that id already exists, the return status will be `400 BAD REQUEST`.
6. If a statement with the specified subject, predicate and object already exists, the id of the existing statement will be returned and the status will be `201 CREATED`.

[[statements-edit]]
== Updating Statements

A `PUT` request updates an existing statement with the given parameters.
The response will be `204 NO CONTENT` when successful.
The updated statement can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

operation::statements-update[snippets='path-parameters,request-fields,curl-request,http-response']

[[statements-delete]]
== Deleting Statement
A `DELETE` request deletes a statement from the graph.
It does not delete its subject or object, except for literal objects.
The response will be `204 No Content` when successful.

[NOTE]
====
1. If the statement is not modifiable, the return status will be `403 FORBIDDEN`.
2. If the statement is a <<lists,list>> element statement, the return status will be `403 FORBIDDEN`.

[[statements-fetch-as-bundle]]
== Fetching Statements as Bundles

A `Bundle` is a collection of statements that represent the subgraph starting from a specified entity in the graph.
A `GET` request fetches a subgraph of a certain entity and returns all the statements as a bundle.
