= Statements

A statement represents a kind of sentence in the knowledge graph,
similar to RDF triples.
Similar to a real sentence, it is a tuple of a subject, a predicate, and
an object.

Subjects and objects represent nodes in the graph are formed from a
<<Resources,resource>>.
Objects can also be a <<Literals,literal value>>.

<<Predicates>> represent edges (relationships) in the graph.

Resources and predicates are identifiable by an ID, whereas literals are
not since they represent a value.

Statements can also be referenced by their IDs.
This allows storing and retrieving provenance information about them.
