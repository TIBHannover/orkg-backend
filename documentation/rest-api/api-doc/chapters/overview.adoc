= Overview

This document describes the REST API of the {orkg}.

WARNING: This API is still **in development** and therefore **unstable** and **subject to change**!
Be aware that the API can (and will) break without notice, so beware if you intend to consume it directly.
We will support a stable API in the future, but it is uncertain when that will be.
This documentation will be updated to reflect that.
