= Research Fields

Research fields are meta objects that help better classify the content within the ORKG.
The research field is essentially a <<Resources,resource>> and hence inherits all the specifications of resource.

NOTE: In the following sections, the response fields of the page object are omitted for brevity.

== Research Fields and Research Problems

[[research-fields-list-research-problems]]
=== Listing Research Problems of Research Fields

include::{snippets}/research-fields_find-all-research-problems-by-research-field-id/description.adoc[]

operation::research-fields_find-all-research-problems-by-research-field-id[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request,errors']

[[research-fields-list-research-problems-with-subfields]]
=== Listing Research Problems of Research Fields and their Subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/research-problems` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of research problem <<resources,resources>> belonging to a given research field and its subfields.

All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-list-research-problems,endpoint without subfields>>.


== Research Fields and Contributors

[[research-fields-list-contributors]]
=== Listing Contributors of Research Fields

include::{snippets}/research-fields_find-all-contributors-by-research-field-id/description.adoc[]

operation::research-fields_find-all-contributors-by-research-field-id[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']

[[research-fields-list-contributors-with-subfields]]
=== Listing Contributors of Research Fields and their Subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/contributors` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of contributors that contributed to a given research field and its subfields.
All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-list-contributors,endpoint without subfields>>.
