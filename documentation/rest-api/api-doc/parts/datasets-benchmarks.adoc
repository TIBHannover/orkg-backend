= Datasets & Benchmarks

Some datasets and benchmarks on said datasets are imported into the ORKG.
Certain statistics can be obtained through the benchmark endpoint of the rest API.

[[research-fields-with-bechmark-list]]
== Listing Research Fields with Benchmarks

A `GET` request lists all the research fields with benchmarks (i.e., all research fields that have papers containing benchmarks in their contributions).

[[benchmarks-by-field-list]]
== Listing Benchmarks by Research Field

A `GET` request lists benchmarks under a certain research field.
