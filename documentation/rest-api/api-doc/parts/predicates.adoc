= Predicates

Predicates represent edges (relationships between nodes) in the
knowledge graph.
They consist of an ID and a label (for presentation).
IDs always start with "P", followed by a number.

[[predicates-fetch]]
== Fetching Predicates

A `GET` request provides information about a predicate.

operation::predicates-fetch[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

[[predicates-list]]
== Listing Predicates

A `GET` request returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of <<predicates-fetch,predicates>>.
If no paging request parameters are provided, the default values will be used.

operation::predicates-get-paged[snippets='curl-request']

The following list of request parameters are supported:

operation::predicates-get-paged-with-parameters[snippets='query-parameters,curl-request']

[[predicates-create]]
== Creating Predicates

A `POST` request creates a new predicate with a given label.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The predicate can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

NOTE: The response body contains the created predicate for convenience. This might be subject to change.

[[predicates-edit]]
== Updating Predicates

A `PUT` request updates a predicate with a new given label.
The response will be `200 OK` when successful.
The updated predicate is returned in the body for convenience.

operation::predicates-edit[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request,http-response']

[[predicates-delete]]
== Deleting Predicates

A `DELETE` request with the id of the predicate to delete.
The response will be `204 NO CONTENT` when successful.

[NOTE]
====
1. If the predicate doesn't exist, the return status will be `404 NOT FOUND`.
2. If the predicate is not modifiable, the return status will be `403 FORBIDDEN`.
3. If the predicate is used in a statement (excluding subject position), the return status will be `403 FORBIDDEN`.
4. If the performing user is not the creator of the predicate and does not have the curator role, the return status will be `403 FORBIDDEN`.

[[predicates-import]]
== Importing Predicates

The {orkg} REST API provides two endpoints for importing predicates from external ontologies.

[[predicates-import-by-uri]]
=== Importing Predicates by URI

A `POST` request imports a predicate from an external ontology by a given URI.

operation::import-import-predicate-by-uri[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']
The response will be `201 Created` when successful, even when the predicate was already imported previously.

[[predicates-import-by-short-form]]
=== Importing Predicates by Short Form

A `POST` request imports a predicate from an external ontology by a given short form id.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful, even when the predicate was already imported previously.

operation::import-import-predicate-by-short-form[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']
