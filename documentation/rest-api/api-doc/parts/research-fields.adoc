== Research Fields

Research fields are meta-objects that help better classify the content within the ORKG.
The research field is essentially a <<Resources,resource>> and hence inherits all the specifications of resource.

All `GET` requests share the same path parameter, listed below, and support <<visibility-filter,visibility filtering>>.
The responses are <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>>.

==== Path parameters
include::{snippets}/research-fields-get-paged/path-parameters.adoc[]

NOTE: In the following sections, the response fields of the page object are omitted for brevity.


=== Research fields and content types

[[research-fields-fetch]]
==== Fetching content types of a research field

A `GET` request for a given research field returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of content type resources that belong to this research field.
Certain subsets of content types are obtained via the `classes` parameter.
The endpoint supports <<visibility-filtering-legacy>>.

operation::research-fields-get-paged[snippets='path-parameters,request-parameters,response-fields',curl-request]

[[research-fields-fetch-with-subfields]]
==== Fetching content types of a research field and its subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of content type resources belonging to a given research field and its subfields.
All path, request and response parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-fetch,endpoint without subfields>>.


=== Research fields and research problems

[[research-fields-list-research-problems]]
==== Listing research problems of a research field

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/problems` lists all research problems used within all papers under the specified research field, along with their paper count.
The endpoint supports <<visibility-filtering-legacy>>.

operation::research-fields-get-problems-per-field[snippets='response-fields']

The response objects have the following form:

include::{snippets}/research-fields-get-problems-per-field/response-fields-papers-per-problem.adoc[]

operation::research-fields-get-problems-per-field[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[research-fields-list-research-problems-with-subfields]]
==== Listing Problems in field including sub research fields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/research-problems` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of research problem resources belonging to a given research field and its subfields.
All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-fetch,endpoint without subfields>>.


=== Research fields and papers

[[research-fields-list-papers]]
==== Listing Papers of a research field

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/papers` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of paper resources belonging to a given research field.

operation::research-fields-get-papers-per-field[snippets='response-fields,curl-request,http-response']


[[research-fields-list-papers-including-subfields]]
==== Listing Papers of a research field and its subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/papers` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of paper resources belonging to a given research field and its subfields.
All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-list-papers,endpoint without subfields>>.


=== Research fields and contributors

[[research-fields-list-contributors]]
==== Listing Contributors of a research field

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/contributors` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of contributors that contributed to a given research field.

WARNING: This endpoint does *not* support <<visibility-filter,visibility filtering>>!
         The only supported path parameter is `featured`.

operation::research-fields-get-contributors-per-field[snippets='response-fields,curl-request,http-response']

[[research-fields-list-contributors-with-subfields]]
==== Listing Contributors of a research field and its subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/contributors` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of contributors that contributed to a given research field and its subfields.
All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-list-comparisons,endpoint without subfields>>.


=== Research fields and comparisons

[[research-fields-list-comparisons]]
==== Listing comparisons of a research field

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/comparisons` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of comparison resources belonging to a given research field.

operation::research-fields-get-comparisons-per-field[snippets='response-fields,curl-request,http-response']

[[research-fields-list-comparisons-including-subfields]]
==== Listing comparisons of a research field and its subfields

A `GET` request to `/api/research-fields/{id}/subfields/comparisons` returns a <<sorting-and-pagination,paged>> list of comparison resources belonging to a given research field and its subfields.
All path and request parameters are exactly the same as on the <<research-fields-list-comparisons,endpoint without subfields>>.


[[research-fields-list-children]]
=== Listing subfields

A `GET` request lists all sub research fields of a research field.
