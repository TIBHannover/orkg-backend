= Sorting and Pagination

For all request that lists entities, pagination and sorting are applied automatically.
The attributes of paged responses are described in the section about <<page-representation, Page representations>>.

Endpoints supporting paging all take the following (optional) request parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
include::{snippets}/paged-page/query-parameters.adoc[]

An example of a response of a paged list looks like this:

include::{snippets}/paged-page/response-body.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/paged-page/response-fields.adoc[]

NOTE: The elements in `content` can be objects of arbitrary structure and are sorted according to the request parameters, if the endpoint supports it.

By default, sorting is done by the `created_at` property (time-based).
