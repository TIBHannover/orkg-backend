= Visibility filter

Most content types support visibility filtering.
The filtering is supported in `GET` requests via the "visibility" request parameter:

operation::visibility-request-params[snippets='query-parameters']

[[visibility-filtering-legacy]]
== Visibility filtering (obsolete)

To be backwards compatible, some endpoints support visibility filtering via additional request parameters in addition to the `<<visibility-filter,visibility>>` request parameter.
If the `visibilty` request parameter is used, both `featured` and `unlisted` are ignored.
If it is absent, it will be set according to the values of the two parameters.

WARNING: The use of these request parameters is deprecated and may be removed at some point.
         Clients are encouraged to transition to using the mechanism described in <<visibility-filter>>.
