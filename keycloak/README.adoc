This file contains JSON files to be imported by Keycloak on startup.
They are created by using the export functionality of the keycloak instance.
The following command can be used to trigger the export:

    kc export --dir=/opt/keycloak/data/export --users=realm_file --realm orkg --optimized

To improve diffs when changes are made, the JSON objects should be sorted by their keys.
This can be achieved e.g. by running them through `jq`:

    jq --sort-keys . realm_orkg.json > sorted.json
