This file contains JSON files to be imported by Keycloak on startup.
They are created from the adminstration interface, using the export functionality.

To improve diffs when changes are made, the JSON objects should be sorted by their keys.
This can be achieved e.g. by running them through `jq`:

    jq --sort-keys . exported.json > old_export.json
