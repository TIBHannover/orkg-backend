[[overview]]
== Overview

This document describes the REST API of the {orkg}.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

The {orkg} REST API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard
 HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource
|===

The verbs `PATCH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are (currently) unsupported.
////
| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes
The {orkg} REST API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard
 HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
The actual response will depend on the request method used.
In a `GET` request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
In a `POST` request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

[[statements]]
== Statements

A statement represents a kind of sentence in the knowledge graph,
 similar to RDF triples.
Similar to a real sentence, it is a tuple of a subject, a predicate, and
 a object.

Subjects and objects represent nodes in the graph are formed from a
 <<Resources,resource>>.
Objects can also be a <<Literals,literal value>>.

<<Predicates>> represent edges (relationships) in the graph.

Resources and predicates are identifiable by an ID, whereas literals are
 not since they represent a value.

Statements can also be referenced by their IDs.
This allows to store and retrieve provenance information about them.

[[statements-list]]
=== Listing statements

A `GET` request lists all the statements:

operation::statement-controller-test-index[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[statements-create]]
=== Creating statements
A `POST` request creates a new statement.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The statement can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

NOTE: The created statement is returned in the body for convenience. This might be subject to change.

Creating statements can be done in two ways:

1. For objects of type resource, send three IDs.
2. For objects of type literal, send two IDs and the literal value in the body.

[[statements-create-objects-resource]]
==== Creating statements with resource objects

Create a statement by submitting three IDs via `POST`:

operation::statement-controller-test-add-with-resource[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request,http-response']

[[statements-fetch]]
=== Fetching a statement

A `GET` request provides information about a statement.

operation::statement-controller-test-fetch[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[statements-lookup-by-subject]]
=== Lookup statements by subject

A `GET` request lists all the statements with a given subject:

operation::statement-controller-test-lookup-by-subject[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[statements-lookup-by-predicate]]
=== Lookup statements by predicate

A `GET` request lists all the statements with a given predicate:

operation::statement-controller-test-lookup-by-predicate[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[resources]]
== Resources

Resources represent nodes in the knowledge graph.
They can appear in the subject or object position in <<Statements,statements>>.

[[resources-list]]
=== Listing resources

A `GET` request lists all resources:

operation::resource-controller-test-index[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[resources-create]]
=== Creating resources

A `POST` request creates a new resource with a given label.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The resource can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

NOTE: The created resource is returned in the body for convenience. This might be subject to change.

operation::resource-controller-test-add[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']

The response body consists of the following fields:

operation::resource-controller-test-add[snippets='response-fields']

[[resources-fetch]]
=== Fetching a resource

A `GET` request provides information about a resource.

operation::resource-controller-test-fetch[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[resources-lookup]]
=== Lookup a resource by label

Resources can be looked up by label by providing a search fragment.

operation::resource-controller-test-lookup[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[predicates]]
== Predicates

Predicates represent edges (relationships between nodes) in the
 knowledge graph.
They consist of an ID and a label (for presentation).
IDs always start with "P", followed by a number.

[[predicates-list]]
=== Listing predicates

A `GET` request lists all predicates:

operation::predicate-controller-test-index[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[predicates-create]]
=== Creating predicates

A `POST` request creates a new predicate with a given label.
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The predicate can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

NOTE: The created predicate is returned in the body for convenience. This might be subject to change.

operation::predicate-controller-test-add[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']

The response body consists of the following fields:

operation::predicate-controller-test-add[snippets='response-fields']

[[predicates-fetch]]
=== Fetching a predicate

A `GET` request provides information about a predicate.

operation::predicate-controller-test-fetch[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[predicates-lookup]]
=== Lookup a predicate by label

Predicates can be looked up by label by providing a search fragment.

operation::predicate-controller-test-lookup[snippets='curl-request,http-response']


[[literals]]
== Literals

Literals represent nodes in the knowledge graph.
They can appear in the object position in <<Statements,statements>>.

[[literals-list]]
=== Listing Literals

A `GET` request lists all literals:

operation::literal-controller-test-index[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[literals-create]]
=== Creating Literals

A `POST` request creates a new literal with a given label (its value).
The response will be `201 Created` when successful.
The resource can be retrieved by following the URI in the `Location` header field.

NOTE: The created literal is returned in the body for convenience. This might be subject to change.

operation::literal-controller-test-add[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']

The response body consists of the following fields:

operation::literal-controller-test-add[snippets='response-fields']

[[literals-fetch]]
=== Fetching a literal

A `GET` request provides information about a literal.

operation::literal-controller-test-fetch[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[literals-lookup]]
=== Lookup a literal by label

Literals can be looked up by label by providing a search fragment.

operation::resource-controller-test-lookup[snippets='curl-request,http-response']
