=== Getting dump

A `GET` request creates a dump of the graph and returns it as file.
The response will be `200 OK` when successful.
As a result of the request a file will be provided with the name `dump.nt` that can be used or imported into other RDF stores.

NOTE: The created paper root resource is returned in the body for convenience. This might be subject to change.
